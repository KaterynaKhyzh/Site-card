      <h2>Key Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Language Learning (German & English)</strong>  <br></br> I am actively improving my language skills, having just started learning German, currently at the early A1 level. At the same time, I am focusing on enhancing my English proficiency, which is at a B2 level, by engaging in regular practice and advanced learning techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Photography & Filming</strong> <br></br> Photography started as an idea for a potential career path, but over time, it transformed into a hobby. Now, I mostly take photos of my friends and capture short films during my travels and walks to preserve memories. It has become a creative outlet for me to document moments and explore the world through my lens.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Management Enthusiast</strong><br></br> I am currently deepening my Project Management knowledge through a course, focusing on agile methodologies, stakeholder management, risk assessment, and project lifecycle. So far, I've covered areas such as SDLC, project initiation, task estimation, budgeting, and prioritization.</li>
        <li><strong>Dancing</strong><br></br>Dancing is one of the sports I practice to maintain my physical health and well-being. It allows me to stay active, improve my coordination, and maintain flexibility, while also helping me to relieve stress and boost my mood. </li>
      </ul>
